1) In ProjectB we implemented many new functions such as, readString,ReadSector,handleInterrupt,printString. We created these funcitons using the systems interrupts to get things like input from the keyboard, or reading chars from certain strings or sectors. 2) The way we were able to verify that these functions worked was by opening up the similator and testing the functions to see if they correctly displayed the output that we wanted.
